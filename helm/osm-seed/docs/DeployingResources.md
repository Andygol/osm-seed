# Deploying osm-seed locally step by step

This is an alternative guide to make the deployment little by little, according to the resources that are being used!!

## Deploying Database and API pods.

Let's start by installing the Chart in the cluster, it could be locally or in the cloud, in this case, let's use a local minikube cluster.

Let's keep the following files in `template` folder.

```
_helpers.tpl
db-pd.yaml
db-service.yaml
db-statefulset.yaml
ingress.yaml
web-deployment.yaml
web-service.yaml
```

Make sure you `value.yaml` configuration was filled, and then execute ðŸ‘‡

```
$ cd osm-seed/helm/
$ helm install -n dev -f osm-seed/dev.values.yaml osm-seed/
```

let's check if the pods are running ðŸ‘‰ `kubectl get pods`

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
dev-db-0                            1/1       Running   0          1m
dev-osm-seed-web-74b7b58765-h9tqt   1/1       Running   0          1m
```

Let's check if our application is running correctly, we will execute ðŸ‘‰ `minikube service dev-osm-seed-web --url` to access the application.

```
$ minikube service dev-osm-seed-web --url
http://192.168.64.22:30483
```

For local deployment, we have to update the domain part in the values.yaml file, using the ip which we got.ðŸ‘‰ `192.168.64.22:30483`


```yaml
domain:
  enabled: true 
  domainName: 192.168.64.22:30483
  protocolo: http
```

And then upgrade the stack: ðŸ‘‡

```
$ cd osm-seed/helm/
$ helm upgrade -f osm-seed/dev.values.yaml dev osm-seed/
```

*Note: The osm application could take couple of minutes to start up.* 

Open the ip `http://192.168.64.22:30483`, and verify that the osm application is working. Everything is going fine so far ðŸ˜ƒ!!!

## Deploying popupate-apidb pod

In order to deploy this container, we can use `kubectl`, or we can also add the file `populate-apidb-job.yaml` in the `templates` folder, the result would be ðŸ‘‡

```
_helpers.tpl
db-backup-job.yaml
db-pd.yaml
db-service.yaml
db-statefulset.yaml
ingress.yaml
populate-apidb-job.yaml
web-deployment.yaml
web-service.yaml
```

And then upgrade the stack !! ðŸ‘‡

```
$ cd osm-seed/helm/
$ helm upgrade -f osm-seed/dev.values.yaml dev osm-seed/
```

You will see a result like this ðŸ‘‡


```
NAME                               READY  STATUS             RESTARTS  AGE
dev-osm-seed-web-68dbd7768f-qlt8r  1/1    Running            0         17m
dev-db-0                           1/1    Running            0         34m
dev-populate-apidb-job-ftght       0/1    ContainerCreating  0         0s
```

To verify the status of the import execute command 

```
kubectl logs dev-populate-apidb-job-ftght
```

Result ðŸ‘‡

Now you have the Monaco country imported into your local database. For verifying if the data is in the Database, we will export some data from Monaco from our instance.


```
wget -O map.osm http://192.168.64.22:30483/api/0.6/map?bbox=7.42529%2C43.7381%2C7.42855%2C43.73984s
```

## Deploying iD-editor pod

In order to deploy an iD-editor, we need create copy the files `id-editor-deployment.yaml` and  `id-editor-service.yaml` into the `templates` folder.

The reults would be ðŸ‘‡

```
_helpers.tpl
db-backup-job.yaml
db-pd.yaml
db-service.yaml
db-statefulset.yaml
id-editor-deployment.yaml
id-editor-service.yaml
ingress.yaml
populate-apidb-job.yaml
web-deployment.yaml
web-service.yaml

```

And then upgrade the stack !! ðŸ‘‡

```
$ cd osm-seed/helm/
$ helm upgrade -f osm-seed/dev.values.yaml dev osm-seed/
```

Result ðŸ‘‡

```
NAME                                   READY  STATUS             RESTARTS  AGE
dev-osm-seed-id-editor-b96f79c8-f72kg  0/1    ContainerCreating  0         0s
dev-osm-seed-web-68dbd7768f-qlt8r      1/1    Running            0         48m
dev-db-0                               1/1    Running            0         1h
dev-populate-apidb-job-ftght           0/1    Completed          0         30m
```

In the case of minikube, the assignment of the ports are randomly, so we can check on which port is running the iD-editor.


```
$ minikube service dev-osm-seed-id-editor --url
http://192.168.64.22:31711
```
